# IMDb Code

An easy-to-use commandline tool to easily look up the IMDb ID of a movie given its name

It's built for both easy interactive use and scripting capabilities

## Why does this exist?

Because *certain sites* support searching using these IMDb IDs and it's really useful as an unambiguous identifier

## How do I install it?

You need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed on your system, then run the following:

```shell
cargo install imdb-id
```

(please note this isn't yet live on crates.io, but shall be when it's released)

## Usage

To be decided...
